2.6.0 Testing Addendum
======================

1. There's new logic to obtain the time when TagTrak starts up for the first time after a clean install. If the initial connection fails, 
   we have no way of knowing if the time/time zone settings are right and we force the user to try and set those without needing a password. 
   If after this the location is changed (from within the scanning screen) the scanner operates in a special mode where it doesn't know the time.
  
  - Things to test:
    - Do a clean install and then do a check upload download WITHOUT having a connection to the Internet, let it FAIL to enter this new special mode.
    - Play around and make sure everything works here bofore you do a sync. Scan stuff, use different function, ect...
    
  - Note:
    - If the scanner has absolutely no idea what time it is, you'll get a message box telling you to set the time. This is only for testing and 
      will not happen in production versions. If you see these, make a note of where/when they showed up.
    
2. I've changed the way TagTrak gets the list of all possible cities. It now downloads them from FTP. This 
   mostly affects the routing screen for international.
  
    - Things to test:
        - Routing screen for bar codes without routing information. Also test this when doing test 1.
        
3. Time/time zone testing. I've scrapped the old time/time zone infrastructure and put in a new one.

    - What to test:
        - Pay special attention to time/date correctness for various location.
