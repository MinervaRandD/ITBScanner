<!-- ---------------- Load Modules ---------------- -->
<p>&nbsp;<!-- PegHelp --><hr><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->
<a name="load_module"></a><b>Load Modules</b>
<br>
CORE modules are collections of specific information.  This information is
usually related to a particular radio technology, but not always.  
Each module can display general and detailed information.
Click on the tabs near the bottom of the screen to switch between the 
module's general and detailed information.  
			[Note: Not all modules will have detailed information]
			<p>
CORE manages one module at a time.  If you have more than one module installed in
CORE, you can easily switch from one module to another.   If you would like to 
select a new module to manage, select <tt>Choose Module...</tt> from the Modules 
menu.
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>In the Choose Module screen you will see a list of your 
			installed modules.  Each module will display it's name, version, and
			filename.
		<li>Select the one you would like to manage and tap 
			the Choose button.
		<li>If you tap the Cancel button, no changes will be made.
		<li>You may also jump to the Add/Remove screen from within the 
			Choose Module screen by tapping the button labeled "Go to Add/Remove".

<!-- ---------------- Add/Remove Modules ---------------- -->
<p>&nbsp;<!-- PegHelp --><hr><!-- *****Topic Break**** -->
<a name="add_remove"></a><b>Add/Remove Modules</b>
<br>
CORE lets you easily add modules.  For example, each time you receive a new type
of radio that you need to configure and manage, you will install the software,
which will not only update the CORE utility, but also install the necessary
modules and drivers.
<p>

	CORE separates modules into Installed and Available.
	<ul>
		<li>Installed modules are active.  You can select from the installed 
			modules in the Choose Module screen.
		<li>Available modules are modules on your system that you aren't 
			currently using.  If you know for sure you will never use a 
			particular module, you can feel free to delete it.
	</ul>
</p>
<b>To add a module</b>

<ol>
	<li>Install the software that you received.</li>
	
	<li>From the Modules menu, choose Add/Remove. The Add/Remove Modules dialog 
	box appears.</li>
	
	<li>In the Available box, select the module that you want to add.</li>
	
	<li>Click Add. The module is added to the Installed box and removed from 
	the Available box.</li>
</ol>
<b>To remove a module</b>

<ol>
	
	<li>From the Modules menu, choose Add/Remove. The Add/Remove Modules 
	dialog box appears.</li>
	
	<li>In the Installed box, select the module that you no longer need.</li>
	
	<li>Click Remove. The module is removed from the Installed box and added 
	to the Available box.</li>
</ol>
