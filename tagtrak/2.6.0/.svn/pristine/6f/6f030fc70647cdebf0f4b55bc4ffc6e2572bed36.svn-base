Change Log
==========

2.6.0
-----

* Unload entire flight functionality. If a bar code is scanned in the Unload operation from a flight for 
  which we know the loaded barcodes, the user gets a prompt asking if they want to unload the entire flight.
  Answering "Yes" will unload all barcodes Loaded onto that flight, "No" will unload only that bar code.

* Updated Symbol and Dolphin support including scanner beam control.

* TagTrak now relies exclusively on the server for time zone information and the city list. This ensures 
  that TagTrak always has the most accurate and up to date time zone and city information.

2.5.8
-----

* Fixed invalid preset record on upgrade from old version.

2.5.7
-----

* Fixed FTPTime offset.
* Fixed Unload International scan.

2.5.6
-----

* Fixed domestic delivery scans.

2.5.5
-----

* New more consistent versioning scheme [Major].[Minor].[Revision].[Internal Build].
	+ [Major].[Minor]  - Denote major and minor program updates.
	+ [Revision]  - Denotes a small feature addition or bug fix.
	+ [Internal Build]  - Denotes the build number. It's used for internal testing and is not always shown.
	
* Fixed the	"Unload Entire Cart" feature. It will now transmit the necessary information in the correct format.

* Implemented NTP time synchronization. This is done before sending scan data and requires UDP connectivity, 
  because of this it does not work with ActiveSync. In that case, it will fall back to the FTPtime method 
  of synchronizing the clock. Accuracy of NTP time synchronization is in the millisecond range.

* Improved the accuracy of the FTPtime synchronization method. It's accuracy is now in the seconds range.

* Re-mapping of operation names is now possible via. the XML configuration files. Each carrier can now have 
  different operation names displayed in the operations combo box. This is effective for Domestic and 
  International mail.

* Support for more time zones and cities added.

* Flight schedule support. When flight schedule data is available and when using applicable operation the 
  flight/destination/origin will be checked for validity and a warning will pop up on a mismatch allowing 
  the user to ignore the current scan.
  
* Changed how unload entire cart works, answering "No" to "Do you want to unload the entire cart/flight?"
  will only unload that one item.
  
* Daylight savings time 2007 fix.
